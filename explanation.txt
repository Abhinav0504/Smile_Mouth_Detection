Command-line Input:

The program takes an image path and an optional flag --mouth-only as command-line arguments.
Loading Models:

Separate functions to load the face detection model, facial landmarks model, and Keras smile classification model.
Running Inference:

The RunInference function is used to process the input image and run inference on the models.
Getting Landmarks:

The GetLandmarks function extracts the landmarks from the output of the landmarks model.
Mouth Landmarks:

The GetMouthLandmarks function extracts only the mouth landmarks if the --mouth-only flag is set.
Classifying Smile:

The ClassifySmile function prepares the input for the Keras model, runs the classification, and returns "Smile" or "No Smile" based on the classification score.
